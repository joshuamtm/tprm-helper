## Enhanced Decision Framework

### Risk Classifications

#### **Critical Risk** üî¥
- **Data Types**: SSNs, payment cards, PHI, financial accounts, biometric data
- **Examples**: Payroll systems, banking platforms, ERP with full access
- **Requirements**: SOC 2 Type 2 or ISO 27001, SecurityScorecard grade B+
- **Auto-Escalation**: Sensitive data for 1000+ users

#### **High Risk** üü†  
- **Data Types**: Customer PII, employee data, proprietary business information
- **Examples**: CRM systems, email platforms, document storage
- **Requirements**: Security attestation, regular reviews, grade C+
- **Auto-Escalation**: Sensitive data for 50+ users

#### **Medium Risk** üü°
- **Data Types**: Limited business data, contact information
- **Examples**: Project management, analytics platforms, marketing tools
- **Requirements**: Basic security documentation, periodic reviews
- **Threshold**: 10-49 users typically

#### **Low Risk** üü¢
- **Data Types**: Public information, general business tools
- **Examples**: Website monitoring, research tools, public APIs
- **Requirements**: Standard security checks, basic questionnaire
- **Threshold**: <10 users, minimal data access

### Advanced Assessment Criteria

- **Security Posture Analysis** - Multi-factor scoring with detailed breakdowns
- **Compliance Verification** - Framework mapping (SOC 2, ISO 27001, NIST, HIPAA)
- **Public Security Intelligence** - Breach history, vulnerability tracking
- **Risk Escalation Logic** - Automatic threshold-based adjustments
- **Mitigation Factor Recognition** - Credit for strong security controls

## Enhanced Assessment Flow

### Example: CRM System Assessment
1. **Input**: "Assess Salesforce for customer management (High risk, 500 users, customer PII)"
2. **Real-Time Guidance**: System suggests High risk appropriate, warns about user scale
3. **Advanced Analysis**: 
   - Base Risk Score: 30 (High classification)
   - Data Exposure Risk: +20 (customer PII at scale)
   - Security Posture: +2 (Grade B SecurityScorecard)
   - Compliance Credit: -8 (SOC 2 Type 2 verified)
   - **Total Risk Score: 44/100**
4. **Detailed Result**: "APPROVED with monitoring - Strong security posture confirmed"
5. **Comprehensive Explanation**:
   - ‚úÖ SOC 2 Type 2 certification verified
   - ‚úÖ SecurityScorecard grade B indicates strong controls  
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Large user base requires enhanced access controls
   - üìã Next Steps: Include security terms in contract, implement monitoring

### Example: High-Risk Rejection
1. **Input**: "Assess StartupTool for payroll (Critical risk, 1000+ users, SSNs)"
2. **Auto-Escalation**: System escalates to Critical due to SSN + user scale
3. **Analysis Results**:
   - Missing required SOC 2/ISO 27001 certification
   - SecurityScorecard grade D indicates security gaps
   - Recent data breach identified in public records
4. **Decision**: "REJECTED - Critical security deficiencies identified"
5. **Alternatives Provided**: ADP, Workday, Gusto (pre-approved options)
