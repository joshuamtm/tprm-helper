### üîß **Technical Improvements**

#### Architecture Enhancements
- **ENHANCED**: Full TypeScript implementation with strict type safety
- **ENHANCED**: Modular architecture for better maintainability
- **ENHANCED**: Comprehensive constants with guidance data structures
- **ENHANCED**: Improved error handling and user feedback systems

#### Algorithm Improvements
- **ENHANCED**: Risk scoring now uses 6 distinct components instead of simple classification
- **ENHANCED**: Security posture analysis with grade-based risk calculation
- **ENHANCED**: Public security issues analysis with time-weighted breach penalties
- **ENHANCED**: User scale risk calculation with sensitivity multipliers

#### Performance & Security
- **MAINTAINED**: Client-side processing for privacy and security
- **MAINTAINED**: No data persistence or external dependencies
- **IMPROVED**: More efficient form validation and feedback
- **IMPROVED**: Better error handling and edge case management

### üìä **Risk Assessment Algorithm v2.0**

#### New Risk Score Components
1. **Base Risk** (10-40 pts): Risk classification foundation
2. **Data Exposure Risk** (0-25 pts): Sensitive data handling analysis  
3. **User Scale Risk** (0-20 pts): Impact based on user count and data sensitivity
4. **Security Posture Risk** (0-20 pts): SecurityScorecard grade analysis
5. **Compliance Risk** (0-25 pts): Missing certification penalties
6. **Public Issue Risk** (0-40 pts): Breach history and vulnerability analysis
7. **Mitigation Credit** (0-15 pts): Credit for strong security practices

#### Enhanced Escalation Logic
- **Automatic Critical**: Sensitive data + 1000+ users
- **Automatic High**: Sensitive data + 50+ users (from Medium/Low)
- **Security Override**: Grade F always triggers rejection
- **Breach Penalty**: Recent breaches increase risk level

### üéØ **User Experience Improvements**

#### Interactive Guidance
- **Risk Classification Helper**: Expandable panels with detailed examples
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Dynamic warnings and suggestions during input
- **Pattern Recognition**: Automatic vendor type detection and guidance
- **Threshold Alerts**: Warnings when approaching escalation thresholds

#### Enhanced Results Display
- **Risk Breakdown**: Visual component-by-component score analysis
- **Decision Context**: Comprehensive explanations for all decisions
- **Compliance Mapping**: Clear requirements for each risk level
- **Alternative Suggestions**: Pre-approved vendor recommendations for rejections

### üè¢ **Enterprise Features**

#### Professional Reporting
- **Detailed Justifications**: Multi-paragraph explanations with bullet points
- **Compliance Requirements**: Framework-specific guidance (SOC 2, ISO 27001)
- **Risk Factor Analysis**: Identification of specific concerns and mitigations
- **Confidence Indicators**: Assessment reliability based on available data

#### Business Process Integration
- **Approval Workflows**: Clear next steps for each decision type
- **Documentation Standards**: Professional PDF exports with detailed analysis
- **Risk Tolerance Guidance**: Framework for organizational risk appetite
- **Vendor Alternatives**: Curated suggestions for rejected vendors

### üÜï **New Constants and Configuration**

#### Risk Classification Guidance
```typescript
RISK_CRITERIA: {
  [RiskLevel.CRITICAL]: {
    description: 'Handles highly sensitive data, critical business functions...',
    detailedDescription: 'Critical vendors have access to the most sensitive...',
    examples: ['Core business applications', 'Financial systems', 'Healthcare systems'],
    dataTypes: ['Social Security Numbers', 'Payment card information', 'PHI'],

  }
  // Extended for all risk levels
}
```

```typescript
SENSITIVE_DATA_GUIDE: {
  categories: {
    'Personally Identifiable Information (PII)': {
      description: 'Information that can identify, contact, or locate...',
      examples: ['Full names with other identifiers', 'Social Security Numbers', ...],
